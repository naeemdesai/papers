Applied Inverse Problems in the Defense Sector

Dr. Naeem Desai, Prof. William Lionheart and Prof. John Graphene

# Introduction
This paper gives us a novel method for upscaling reservoir modelling for a specific application under consideration (Lionheart, 2017). Naeem Desai (2018) gave model with deficiencies.

# Methodology
Do we want to use a deterministic approach or bayesian approach?

# Simulations
John Graphene devised a new Forward model for a defense application. 

# Results
The simulation reproduced a source-detector problem scenario. Hence ideas presented in (2017, SIAM) can be of use.

# Conclusions
We need to develop a new adjoin formulation fo this specific defence application to work well.

# Figures
We show figures of the forward problem and proposed reconstructed images from the proposed inverse problem.
